### Writing

1. Report maximal log BF errors by axiom.
1. Make sure domain names are consistent everywhere
1. Change axiom names to WST, MI, TI, Reg, etc.

### R code

1. Create detailed tables for each axiom in supplementary materials

### Someday/Maybe

1. Look up “wisdom of crowds” research in context of questions with objectively right answers

### Other possible analyses (something Clint might do)

1. Construct revealed preference events for individuals (1 for binary, 2 for ternary, etc.), relate across choice sets
1. For each population violation of regularity, mark individuals on either side of inequality (if P(x:yz) > P(x:y) mark individuals who chose x from {x,y,z} or y from {x,y})
