The five cities of this domain have a latitude close to 50 degrees north.
In the above list, they are ordered from furthest north to furthest south.
According to Wikipedia, their latitudes are, respectively, $52 \degree 14^\prime N$, $51 \degree 30^\prime N$, $49 \degree 15^\prime N$, $48 \degree 51^\prime N$ and $47 \degree 36^\prime N$.
There are two potential asymmetric dominance effects, with Vancouver being fairly obviously north of Seattle and London being fairly obviously north of Paris.
