% Star pairs

Here, choice objects are pairs of movie stars from a set of four movie stars: Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.
The only missing pair is Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.
One possible measure of similarity is the number of actors in common between two pairs, with values 0 and 1.
There are nine doubleton choice sets (i.e. pairs of actor pairs) with one star in common and one ($\{c,d\}$) without any stars in common.
Thus there are three triples ($\{a,c,d\}$, $\{b,c,d\}$, $\{c,d,e\}$) where one might expect a similarity effect.

In this example, respondents' preferences may depend not only on their liking of particular actors but also on complementaries between actors.
