This domain is based on an experiment from citeasnoun{WedePett96}.
There are two experiments involving cars in that article, the experiment in question is  numbered 18 in the appendix to that paper.
Objects below have the same attributes as in that experiment and a similar range of levels.
We adapted the objects to allow for compromise effects.
The second panel of Figure \ref{f:CE} shows the choice objects in attribute space.
Table \ref{f:CE} shows the relations of dominance, similarity and betweenness among objects associated with context effects.

\begin{tcolorbox}
Which one of the following cars would you choose to drive, all other features
begin equal? Ride quality is a on a scale of 0 to 100.
