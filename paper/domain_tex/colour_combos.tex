The source for this domain is the website ``The top tens'', page ``Two colors that look good side by side.''
The color combinations here are ranked 1, 4, 5, 13 and 14.
We chose a selection of five high ranking combinations among which there were many colors
in common.
Using a similarity measure equal to the number of colours in common between two pairs, there are two doubleton choice sets where the two colour pairs have no colours in common ($\{a,e\}$ and $\{b,d\}$) and eight where the two colour pairs have one colour in common.
This gives six tripleton pairs in which one might expect a similarity effect.
