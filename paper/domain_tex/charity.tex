% Charity

The charities in this domain are real charities.
The first two are relatively innocuous in the sense that most people support the goals of both.
However, the Canadian Cancer Society attracts much more financial support than Arthritis Research Canada and we might expect that most people would prefer a marginal dollar going to the former.
The two other charities have goals that are nearly opposite and elicit strong emotions (of different kinds) from some.
