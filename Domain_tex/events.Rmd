Which one of the following events do you think is most likely to happen in the next twenty years?

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
	\item Scotland becomes an independent country.
	\item Either Catalonia or Quebec become independent countries.
	\item Catalonia becomes an independent country.
	\item Scotland and Quebec become independent countries.

This domain involves comparisons of the probabilities of future events.
Logically, the probability of event $e$ must be as least as great as the probability of $a$, which must in turn be as least as great as the probability of $d$; also, the probability of $b$ must be as great as the probability of $c$.
This gives some triples in which one might expect an asymmetric dominance effect.
