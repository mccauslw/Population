% Hotel rooms

Using Expedia results, I did a linear regression of price per night on a constant and the Expedia rating, in numbers of stars, for a sample of available hotels.
The five levels of numbers of stars correspond roughly to the mean, plus and minus one sample standard deviation and plus and minus two standard deviations.
Prices are approximately equal to fitted values in the linear regression.
