This domain is loosely based on an experiment by citeasnoun{BenzRapoYagi89}, in which respondents are asked to assign present values equivalent to the receipt of \$200 at time horizons of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 years.
Based on implied discount factors at various terms, we constructed five choice objects designed to have approximately the same present value equivalent.
